        <h2 class="large-text">Granny's Hot Potato Salad</h2>
        <p><strong>It's the absolute <em>best</em> potato salad you'll ever eat.</strong> Savory, tangy, and fresh—it's perfect for cookouts, parties, and even eating it all by yourself (I won't tell if you won't). My granny used to make enough of this salad to fill a washtub and there was never a scrap left over after a party. It is excellent as a side with fried chicken, pulled pork, or ham.</p>
        <p><h3 class="large-text">Give it a try!</h3></p>
        <h2 class="med-text">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>3 lbs fingerling and/or baby red potatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, grated</li>
            <li>1 chopped onion (Vidalia's are recommended, but you can use any kind you want)</li>
            <li>1/2 lb bacon</li>
            <li>Marzetti's Slaw Dressing</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar or honey</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>5-6 stalks chopped green onions</li>
            <li>2-3 chopped hard-boiled eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="med-text">Directions</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>If possible, soak the potatoes overnight (12 hours) in water and apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Pour off the water, rinse, add water to cover potatoes and cook on medium heat until fork tender (NOT mushy!).</li>
            <li>Cut into bite-sized pieces and toss with olive oil (drizzle just enough so they don't get sticky), onion, and garlic.</li>
            <li>Gently mix, cover and let it "hang out and get happy" while you fry the bacon.</li>
            <li>Fry the bacon until it is crisp and crumble it up. Reserve 2 tbsp-ish of bacon grease for later.</li>
            <li>Add 3/4 jar of Marzetti's Slaw Dressing, ground ginger, and honey (or sugar), and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Stir and let it get bubbly and then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Add bacon, chopped eggs, and green onions to the potatoes, then pour the hot dressing over the potato mixture and gently mix around again.</li>
            <li>Enjoy! You can keep the potato salad warm in a crockpot, if you want. It is also excellent re-heated and keeps well.</li>
        </ol>
