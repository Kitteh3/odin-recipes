        <h2>Crispy, Mouth-Watering Brussels Sprouts</h2>
        <p><strong>If you <em>hate</em> Brussels sprouts, you've never had them like this.</strong> Fried in bacon grease, then thrown in the oven to get them perfectly cooked, this recipe will have you eating Brussels Sprouts every chance you get. Trust me. I wasn't a fan either until I tried them like this.</p>
        <p><h3>Give it a try!</h3></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>About 1 lb. Brussels Sprouts, cut in halves</li>
            <li>3-4 pieces of bacon</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp salted butter</li>
            <li>garlic powder</li>
            <li>(optional) honey or maple syrup</li>
            <li>(optional) feta cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350.</li>
            <li>Start by frying up your bacon. You want it to be a little crispy, but not blackened or dry.</li>
            <li>Remove bacon from the pan, leaving the bacon grease. Place bacon on a plate covered in paper towel to cool.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add your chopped Brussels sprouts to the bacon grease in the pan. Be carefulâ€”it may pop grease as you pour.</li>
            <li>Toss Brussels sprouts to coat them in the bacon grease and let it cook for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Crumble you bacon into small pieces and put them in an oven-safe dish (a small casserole dish works perfectly).</li>
            <li>Add garlic powder, butter, salt and pepper to the Brussels sprouts. You may also add a drizzle of honey or maple syrup if you want to add a bit of sweetness. Toss it all together until the Brussels sprouts begin to brown. If they get a little burned, don't worry. It can actually add to the flavor to get the outer leaves a little crispy.</li>
            <li>Pour Brussels sprouts into the oven-safe dish containing your bacon and toss them together. You may add some feta cheese to the top if you wish.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
